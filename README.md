# Garbage-Monitoring-System-IOT-Project

### IOT project for seminar work at the faculty. Topic: garbage monitoring system.

The goal of this project is to create a system for monitoring and managing garbage in a certain area, such as a city. It would display each bin in the area on a website, showing its street, and current occupancy expressed as a percentage. This would be useful for garbage collection trucks, as they would not have to go to every street to check if a bin needs to be emptied. An ultrasonic sensor is used to measure the distance, which is then used to calculate how full the bin is. If the bin is full and needs to be emptied, we will receive an alert indicating its location and that it needs to be emptied.

Equipment: NodeMCU ESP8266, Ultrasonic sensor
